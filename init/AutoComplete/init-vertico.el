;;; Code:
;; Enable vertico
(use-package vertico
  :bind
  ("C-RET" . vertico-exit-input)
  :init
  (vertico-mode)

  ;; Different scroll margin
  ;; (setq vertico-scroll-margin 0)

  ;; Show more candidates
  ;; (setq vertico-count 20)

  ;; Grow and shrink the Vertico minibuffer
  ;; (setq vertico-resize t)

  ;; Optionally enable cycling for `vertico-next' and `vertico-previous'.
  ;; (setq vertico-cycle t)
  )

;; Optionally use the `orderless' completion style. See
;; `+orderless-dispatch' in the Consult wiki for an advanced Orderless style
;; dispatcher. Additionally enable `partial-completion' for file path
;; expansion. `partial-completion' is important for wildcard support.
;; Multiple files can be opened at once with `find-file' if you enter a
;; wildcard. You may also give the `initials' completion style a try.

  ;; The :init configuration is always executed (Not lazy!)

  ;; Must be in the :init section of use-package such that the mode gets
  ;; enabled right away. Note that this forces loading the package.
